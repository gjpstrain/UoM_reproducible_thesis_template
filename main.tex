%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% USAGE INSTRUCTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% - Compile using LuaLaTeX and biber, unless there is a particular reason not to. Do not use the older LaTex/PDFLaTeX or BibTeX (the fonts won't work correctly.)
% - Font and the report 'year' must be specified when all \documentclass or the template won't work correctly. (There's no error checking/default cases!)
% - Options for fonts are: calibri, times, palatino, garamond, arial, tahoma, verdana, trebuchet. Note however that not all these are installed on Overleaf, you need to install to your project 
% - Options for 'year' are: first, second, thesis.
% - If not a thesis, should probably remove the COVID-19 impact statement page
% - As many further packages as wanted can be loaded. Below are just an example set. Note that template itself loads a number of packages, including hyperref.
% - References are handed using biblatex.
% - Don't need to include a \uomdeclarations unless this is a thesis
% - Note there is more documentation in the header of uom_these_casson.cls file if you need more help
% - Link to the presentation of theses policy: http://www.regulations.manchester.ac.uk/pgr-presentation-theses/

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% COVID-19 impact statement %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{uomcovid} % policy asks for statement to be before the title page
  % Policy asks for this to be removed from the final thesis post-examination, which messes up the page numbers somewhat. Done here so that the final post-examination thesis is correct. In the pre-examination thesis the numbers displayed on the page will be one lower than the number displayed by the PDF reader. Remove this page if not wanted/needed, and/or is a first or second year report
  Optional. Delete this section if not needed. This is COVID-19 impact text.
